## Hi there

I don't have much more to say here than you can find either in my bio, or on my website <https://donsz.nl>.

I don't very much like GitHub.
As such, I'm slowly moving things that I can to <https://git.donsz.nl/jana>.
That excludes, of course, forks and projects I work on professionally that are stuck on GitHub like [rust-lang/rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)
